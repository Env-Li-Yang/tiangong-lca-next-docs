The TianGong LCA Platform provides powerful full-text search capabilities, supporting cross-field searches across all data modules. This feature gives TianGong LCA Platform significant advantages in data retrieval compared to other LCA platforms.

## Search Features

- **Full-text search**: Deep search across all fields including but not limited to name, category, flow properties and other key fields
- **Smart matching**: Supports fuzzy search, exact matching and AI-powered recommendations
- **Real-time results**: Instant search results with multi-dimensional filtering and flexible sorting

## Search Examples

### Scenario 1: Process Data Search

1. Navigate to "Open Data" module
2. Select "Process" category
3. Enter "coal" in search box
4. System returns all matching results containing "coal" across fields including name, category, input/output flow names, etc.

Search results for "coal":
